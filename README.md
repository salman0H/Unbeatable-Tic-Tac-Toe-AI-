## 🚀 Features

✅ **Two-Player Mode**: Play against the AI or challenge a friend!  
✅ **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to make unbeatable moves.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive graphical design using Pygame.  
✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Visual representation of moves and immediate win/tie detection.

## 🎲 How to Play

1. **Start** the game; the player ("X") will always go first.
2. Click on a square to make your move.
3. The AI ("O") will respond with its move.
4. The game will end when a player wins or there is a tie.

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

The AI opponent is implemented using the **Minimax Algorithm** with Alpha-Beta Pruning. This ensures the AI plays optimally and cannot lose. The game logic includes:

- **Move Evaluation**: The AI searches all possible moves.
- **Optimal Decision**: The AI evaluates and chooses the best move.
- **Game States**: Win, lose, tie conditions are constantly checked.
